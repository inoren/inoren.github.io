<h2>Wellcome to my site!</h2>

<p>This site was created as an assignment in the course Client based web programing - 1dv022 at LNU.</p>
<p>This is the first time I have worked with a Static site generator and a CSS Preprocessor. I have used Jekyll and Sass to create this site. In my blog you can read more about my experience with this.</p>
