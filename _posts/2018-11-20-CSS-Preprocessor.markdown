<h3>My thoughts on pre-compiling the CSS</h3>
<p>Compared to regular CSS, a preprocessor gives you some more exciting things to use like imports and mixins. It also saves me from repeating myself and keeps the code more clean and neat. I have used the preprocessor Sass for this site.</p>

<p>On this site I have used a couple of the thechniquels Sass has to offer. I have used imports for fonts and other scss files, variabels for colors and spaces on the site and nesting for a cleaner look. I also have a mixin for font size.</p>

<p>In my opinion pre-compiled CSS has more pros than cons. Nesting makes everything look better, and there is less repetition of code. The variables saves me time since I donâ€™t have to make changes in more than one place if I for instance want to change the color of all headings. On the con side debugging is harder since the line numbers don't add up.</p>
