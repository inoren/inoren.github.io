<h3>My thoughts on static site generators</h3>
<p>This is my first time working with a static site generator and the one I used for this site is Jekyll. Now that I've got a hang on how everything works, I think its great. I really like the way you can work with includes and layouts. This makes maintenance really easy.</p>

<p>A static site generator is suitable for blogging or just as a personal site. Its great for beginners with little to no knowledge of HTML since you can use markdown. There are also a lot of templets, so you donâ€™t really have to know CSS either.</p>
